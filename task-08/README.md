# Sir Perceval's quest 
I firstly tried doing this task through javascript but was not able to do so so i switched to python reading various stuffs about perceval
using python.It really took me some time to realise what to do but finally i understood that we just need to get the url of amfoss some how
and put them in the right  place in the command given in  amfoss tasks sheet.I read a lot of different stuffs for this task but the one
which help me the most to understand the task was a youtube video by Hussein Nasser [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlE6o-iYcE)
though it was based on javascript it helped me in understanding what actually the task is.
