I did this task mainly using run and debug method.I took segments of my program from the examples given in the [repository](https://github.com/vartanbeno/go-reddit) provided to us as resources in amfoss tasks sheet.I also googled about the each and every segment of the code in the example which i don't understand which helped me a lot in understanding the concept of this language which i found somewhat something different from other languages.I was first accountering an error because
of not following variable scope and wrong time entry but later i realised this two errors.There are many posts to upvote so i used that code given
in the repository in a loop to upvote all of them.
