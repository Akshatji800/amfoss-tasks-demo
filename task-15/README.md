# Project Euler
I used java for solving the questions of this task because i am familiar with java from class 10 and is most comortable using it.I did 1st program
 in python3 because i was bored writing programs in java.I found these questions easy at first sight but while doing them i found that the
 algorithms to be used in them to solve the problems are little tricky otherwise 1 or 2 test cases will fail what was happening with me in the
 starting while attempting the questions.
 I submitted the questions solution programs using my HackerRank ID with username:zapaktayat
