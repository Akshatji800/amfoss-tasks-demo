# INTROSPECTION
### Why must we choose you?
I when i studied java in class 10 thought of making my carrer in coding field because i love it.I never get bored of doing it.Coding for me
is just like what cricket is to a cricketer that is the one thing i would love to do my whole life.I think amfoss will guide me to the path 
where i can learn more about my passion.I personally feel that seeing this passion of mine amfoss can think of choosing me for the club.I
am a bit lazy in doing my work but this is not same when it comes to coding and tech related stuffs.
### What is your plan for the next 6 months?
I seeing that flutter task was amazed i read many stuffs about that seeing that my dream to become an Android Developer became more
predominant.I want to go ahead in this field as much as i can in the next 6 months and i am sure that if i got selected for amfoss i can
progress at a appreciable rate.I also want to give some focus on academics because my parents want a good result from me.
## How would you contribute back to the club?
I will try to work to the extent of my limits to do what the club wants from me.I would give my best to achieve something in future which 
amfoss could boast of.
## Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
No the selection process is the best i have ever seen.This selection process gives a great learning experience to whosoever who attempt the 
tasks.I was amazed to see what my progress was because of these tasks in one month so i personally find the selection process very ethical.
